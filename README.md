"# Tome-Rater" 
This is the final submission for the Tome Rater project for Programming with Python.

Overall the structure should follow the requirements of the project. A few additions that were made:
1. A few extra methods were designed to solve some calculations, a few were marked to be private (with _methodName)
2. I tried to follow PEP8 as closely as I could (mostly using tools in SublimeText 3)
3. .help() was added to each one, this was there mostly to help me debug the program
4. I had a few methods which had an extra output on its return to help me debug it (like add_user in TomeRater() returns the user 
5. In terms of additional steps, I added extra protection against incorrect values to what I felt was a reasonable extent
6. I also added get_n_most_prolific_readers() and get_n_most_read_books()
